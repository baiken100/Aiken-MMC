						<h2>Call To Action</h2>
						<p class="info">After the goal was set I determined what the call to action would be. This helped determine how the site would be built.</p>
					</header>
					<p>When my research and interviews were over, I had gathered enough information to decide between two to three different "call to actions". Ultimatley I decded to focus on one main CTA which is donations.I learned through my interviews with the staff at MMC that 70% of the donations that they reciece they recieve from in country and the rest come form out of country. This information helped me udnerstand the target audience that I am reaching.</p>
					<h2> Style Tile </h2>
					<div class="inner">
						<div class="image fit">
							<img src="images/StyleTile.jpg" alt="" />
						</div>
						<p>I wanted my style tile to communicate who the poeple of MMC are. I wanted a feel that was personable and relatable for the Camobdian people. Since my call to action is primarily focused in country I put the language of Cambodian people Khmer on the site. </p>
