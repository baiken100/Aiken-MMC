					<h3>Primary Research</h3>
					<p>I did primary research on Mercy Medical Center, although my resources were limited
Mercy Medical Center (MMC) is a non-profit christian hospital located in Cambodia. Their main goal is to provide the best medical care to their patients while spreading the gospel. When looking over their website it was clear that it could be utilized in a smarter way to affect patients and surrounding community. For example it could be a tool to help young mothers keep their children healthy. The website is filled with Cambodian health care statistics, but does little to support the spread knowledge of how to prevent common illnesses. The entire website is in English which could also be changed to aid to citizens who don't read English by having the website written in both English and Khmer. The website is lacking some professional touches such as a logo. There is only one contact email that I could find although the site did list the staff members.</p>
        	<h3>Secondary Research</h3>

					<p> Diving furher into my research was difficult since there were no print materials that I could see. I decided to spread my awareness to other christian or non-profit hospitals located in other countries. I came across Living Hope Medical Center located in China and noticed the website was written in both Chinese and English. MMC has educational videos on their site about how the Cambodian genocide has affected the health care system which then helped me determine what exactly this website could aid.</p>
					<h3>Interviews</h3>
					<p>I knew interviews were going to be a difficult task for me. Cambodia is 12 hour ahead of the US so getting in contact with staff did take a few tries. I also do not have access while I am here in America to interview the patients of the hospital or to talk to in country donors. I was able however to  interview nurses who would be eligible for internships with the hospital.

					<h4>OBGYN Judy Norman</h4>
					<p>When talking with Mrs. Norman the main vision she clarified for the hospital is Luke 9:2. The hospitalâ€™s mission is to proclaim the gospel, provide care for the poor, prepare Khmer health care workers and staff, and to partner with like-minded organizations. The core values to help support the mission and vision include: respect, humility, compassion, teamwork, excellence, passion for the mission. Mrs. Norman clarified that donations cover big expenses like buildings, equipment, new program start up costs, some specialized staff salaries (like the women's health fellowship). Operating costs are covered 70% in country (50/50 from patients and the referral partners) and 30% from international donations. She said one of the hardest situations that the hospital faces staff wise is retaining highly trained and educated staff. They are often enticed away by higher paying jobs, often by other Christian NGOs, after MMC has paid for their education and supported them through the learning process.
					</p>
					<h4>Graduating Nurses</h4>
					<p>	When interviewing Nurses who had potential to intern with MMC. One thing that kept being made known is the appreciation of who MMC is and the fact that it is displayed on their actual website. One big factor for one Nurse, Morgan, was the fact that she could see who she would be working with the patients, and was able to get a feel for the area. Information for them was harder to find about possible staff internships but the history behind the hospital and how the hospital was funded really made an impact with Morgan.
