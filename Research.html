					<h3>Primary Research.</h3>
						<p> Mercy Medical Center (MMC) is a non-profit christian hospital located in Cambodia. Their main goal is to provide the best medical care to their patients while spreading the gospel.When looking over their website it was clear that it could be utilized in a smarter way to affect patients and surrounding community. For example it could be a tool to help young mothers keep their children healthy. The website is filled with Cambodian health care statistics, but does little to support the spread knowledge of how to prevent common illnesses. The entire website is English which could aslo be changed to aid to citizens who don't read English by having the website written in both English and Khmer. The website is lacking some professional touches such as a logo. There is only one contact email that I could find although the site did list the staff members.</p>
						<h3>Secondary Research</h3>
						<p> Diving furher into my research was difficult since there was no print materials that I could see. I decided to spread my awareness to other christian or non-profit hospitals located in other countries. I came across Living Hope Medical located in China and noticed the website was written in both Chinese and English. MMC has educational videos on their site about how the Cambodian genocide has affected the health care system which then helped me determine what exactly this website could aid.</p>
