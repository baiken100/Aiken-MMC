						<p class="info">I used a Human Centered Design worksheet provided by IDEO to aid me in determining the root problem.
						<ul class="actions">.</p>

					<h3>Frame it as a design question.</h3>
						<p>How does MMC website cater to their community?</p>
					<h3>Now, state the impact you're trying to have.</h3>
					<p>Increase knowledge of who MMC is and what they do in the community.</p>
					<h3>What are some possible solutions to your problem?</h3>
					<p>I would utilize web page to the fullest, written in both English and Khmer.I would update the site to cater to all devices.</p>
					<h3>Finally, write down some of the content and constraints that you're facing.</h3>
					<p>I do not know the Khmer language, I do not know that even half of the community has access to a computer, who was the site intended for, how are they supposed to use it?</p>
					<h3>Does your origignal question need a tweak? Try it again.</h3>
					<p>How can I make the site usable for the community of Krong Ta Khmau, how can I make it more impactful for the community and MMC?</p>
