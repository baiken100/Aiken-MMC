						<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p class="info">After I gathered enough research for my clients, I organized a few main goals with the intended audience.</p>
					</header>
					<p>When organizing a few main goals and audiences I needed to be as effective as possible. I started by thinking of broad topics and then focusing down to a main specific goal or audience.</p>
					<p>I decided to lay out some overarching goals for my client, audience, and website</p>

					<li>Raise life Expectancy</li>
				</p>

					<h3>Audience</h3>
					<p>
					<li>Aware of MMC and their services for the community</li>
					<li>Educate on their healthcare option</li>
					<li>Know what MMC is doing in their community</li>
					<li>Know how to dontate to MMC to help fund</li>
				</p>

					<h3>Website</h3>
